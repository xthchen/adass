This folder contains the following data and files that can be used to reproduce the figures/table in the ./Figures folder.

It contains four subfolders containing the following files:

./Simulation Studies/:
    sim.R
    The R script that can be used to reproduce Figures "Figure1_1", "Figure1_2", "Figure2", "Figure3_1", "Figure3_2", "Figure4_1", "Figure4_2", "Figure5_1", "Figure5_2", "Figure6_1", "Figure6_2".
    These Figures represent different scenarios where subset selection and adaptive subset selections are applied. For details of the scenarios, see the comments in the R script.

./Wheat Variety/:
    SRP1172.pdf
    The original pdf file from the University of Kansas that recorded the wheat yield of different wheat variety from various farms. Credit: 2022 Kansas Performance Tests with Winter Wheat Varieties, Kansas State University, August 2022. Contribution number 23 - 025-S from the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station.

    Kansas Winter Wheat productivity - 2022.csv
    A csv file that summarises the yields from different farms and varieties from the SRP1172.pdf file.

    Kansas.R
    The R script that can be used to reproduce the results of "Table 1.png". The "Table 1.png" is a screenshot taken from a table produced using LaTeX using the results from the R file with preference on having varieties that are best in most methods on top.

./Evolve & Resequence/:
    True_hap.rds
    Original haplotype data from  Barghi, N. et al., (2019). Genetic redundancy fuels polygenic adaptation in drosophila. PLOS Biology, 17(2):1â€“31.
    
    hitchhike.R
    The R script that can be used to reproduce Figures "Figure7_1", "Figure7_2", "Figure7_3".

./Figures/:
    This folder contains all Figures and table generated using the script from the previous folders.
